## Architecture Overview

The system is designed as a full-stack application, consisting of a **frontend** built with **Streamlit** for the user interface and a **backend** powered by **FastAPI**. The backend handles creative generation, integrates with external APIs, and manages image scoring. Below is a detailed breakdown of the architecture:

### Frontend (`frontend_ui.py`)
- **Streamlit** is used for creating the user interface. It provides an easy-to-use interface that is interactive and responsive for end-users.
- **Features:**
  - A form for users to input details such as product name, tagline, and custom design prompts.
  - Real-time visualization of generated creatives.
  - Display of scoring breakdown with graphical feedback on the performance of the creative.
  - History tracking to view previously generated creatives.
  - Color palette preview that helps users maintain brand consistency.
  - Download functionality for both the generated creative image and detailed scoring report.

### Backend

#### Main Application (`app.py`)
- **FastAPI** is used as the backend framework for handling API requests and responses.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Coordinates creative generation requests.
  - Integrates with the **Stable Diffusion API** for image generation.
  - Manages interaction with **AWS S3** for storage of generated images and assets.
  - Executes the scoring pipeline, which evaluates the generated creatives against various metrics.

#### Image Generation (`stable_diffusion_api.py`)
- This module interfaces with **Hugging Face's Stable Diffusion API**, which is responsible for generating high-quality images based on structured prompts.
- It takes user inputs such as product name, tagline, and brand guidelines to produce the creative image.
  
#### Prompt Engineering (`prompt_generator.py`)
- Creates and manages structured prompts that are sent to the Stable Diffusion API.
- Ensures proper placement of brand elements (e.g., product image, logo, tagline).
- Incorporates color schemes and design requirements based on user input.

#### Image Analysis (`extract_image_details.py`)
- This module performs post-processing on the generated image:
  - Detects text and evaluates text visibility.
  - Analyzes luminance and brightness to ensure clear visibility.
  - Extracts the color palette and ensures it aligns with brand guidelines.
  - Calculates contrast ratios to ensure design clarity.

#### Scoring System (`score_functions.py`)
- This module implements the scoring logic based on multiple design and branding metrics:
  - **Text Visibility:** Ensures that text is legible and stands out.
  - **Brand Guideline Adherence:** Checks the usage of the brandâ€™s color palette, logo, and typography.
  - **Visual Appeal:** Evaluates the aesthetic qualities of the creative (e.g., composition, layout).
  - **Product Focus:** Measures how prominently the product is featured.
  - **Call-to-Action (CTA) Effectiveness:** Evaluates whether the CTA is visible and compelling.

#### Color Utilities (`color_utils.py`)
- Provides utility functions to handle color operations:
  - Color conversion (e.g., hex to RGB).
  - Predefined color mappings for brand colors.
  - Color distance calculations to measure how closely a color matches the brand palette.

#### Storage (`s3_uploader.py`)
- Manages integration with **AWS S3** for storing generated images and other assets.
- Handles file uploads, image storage, and presigned URL generation for easy access to the files.

### Data Flow
1. **Frontend Interaction:** The user submits inputs such as product name, tagline, and other design preferences via the Streamlit interface.
2. **API Call:** The backend receives the request, generates a structured prompt, and sends it to the Stable Diffusion API for image generation.
3. **Image Generation:** The Stable Diffusion model generates the image based on the prompt provided.
4. **Image Analysis:** Once the image is generated, it is analyzed for adherence to brand guidelines and scoring metrics.
5. **Scoring:** The scoring system evaluates the image against predefined metrics and returns a score.
6. **Return Data:** The results (image, score, and feedback) are sent back to the frontend for user review.
7. **Storage:** The image is stored in AWS S3, and a link is provided to the user for download or further processing.

This architecture ensures a streamlined workflow for generating and scoring ad creatives, allowing for real-time feedback and seamless integration between various components.
